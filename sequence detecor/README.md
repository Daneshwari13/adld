Finite state machine (FSM) is a term used by programmers, mathematicians, engineers and other professionals to describe a mathematical model for any system that has a limited number of conditional states of being
There are two types of finite state machines that generate output âˆ’
1.Mealy Machine
2.Moore machine
Mealy Machine:
A Mealy Machine is an FSM whose output depends on the present state as well as the present input.
Moore Machine:
Moore machine is an FSM whose outputs depend on only the present state.
