Pipelining is the process of accumulating instruction from the processor through a
pipeline. It allows storing and executing instructions in an orderly process. It is
also known as pipeline processing.
Pipelining is a technique where multiple instructions are overlapped during
execution. Pipeline is divided into stages and these stages are connected with one
another to form a pipe like structure. Instructions enter from one end and exit from
another end.
